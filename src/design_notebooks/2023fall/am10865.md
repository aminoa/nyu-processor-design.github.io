# Aneesh's Design Notebook

## September 30th, 2023:
Project Work:
- Started Lab 3 [here](https://github.com/aminoa/proc-design/tree/main/labs/lab3)

I started working through the exercises and was making progress on the second part; however, I wasn't sure how to use the testing framework properly with the second test so I stopped for now. I'll try to make progress on the rest of this lab throughout this week

Project Work:
- Did Lab 2 [here](https://github.com/aminoa/proc-design/tree/main/labs/lab2)

I brushed up on some basic verilog and was able to build the project. I then worked on this weeks lab (sometimes peeking at the implementations done by Siddharth and Nicky if I got stuck) and was able to pass all test cases. Note that I plan on shifting my processor design work to be done on the weekend for the rest of the semester.

## September 18th, 2023:

Project Work:
- Set up [GitHub fork](https://github.com/aminoa/nyu-processor-design.github.io) to work on projects and submit pull requests
- Did Lab 1 [here](https://github.com/aminoa/proc-design/tree/main/labs/lab1)

I got my GitHub repo set up and worked on setting up my development environment. I also got through the first lab. I plan on getting through the rest of them throughout this week.
